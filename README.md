# Data Science Projects
Hello, my name is Dan Colvin. I am a passionate Data Scientist with 5+ years of relevant data analysis/data science experience and a Masters Degree in Data Science (formerly Predictive Analytics) from Northwestern University. Feel free to view my past projects which showcase my experience in Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning using R and Python.

## Project Summary
Read below for a short description of each project. Then, select the Jupyter Notebook for that project to see how I solved the problem as well as the code used to reach a solution.

#### Energy Savings Measurement and Verification
This is an example of my main role at the Energy Conservation Office. Engineers in the office identify and fix inefficiencies related to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in campus buildings at UC Davis. Using multiple linear regression, I then create a descriptive model of energy use before a project is initiated. The model is applied to the post-project time period to represent how much energy would have been used and is compared to real data to quantify energy savings.

#### Predicting restaurant visitors in Japan
The capstone project for my graduate program was to solve a practical business problem to completion. My teams project was to help new and existing restaurant owners by creating a tool for them to predict restaurant visitors based on time, genre, or location. Various machine learning models were used for this project using R including XGBoost (the final model). In addition, a Tableau dashboard was created and a web-based application.

#### Predicting chilled water demand for more efficient operation
This project developed a predictive model to predict how much cooling is needed for the entire UC Davis campus. By predicting chilled water demand, central heating and cooling plant operators can allocate the proper amount of resources to produce the cooling energy instead of the traditional method of using the same amount of resources every day regardless of demand. Regression, tree methods, support vector regression, and deep learning neural networks are explored. 

#### Targeted marketing to increase profits
Instead of sending a pamphlet to all potential donors, this project explored targeting specific groups who were more likely to donate. Given a dataset of historical donations and census data, various machine learning classification models were explored to predict whether someone would donate or not. Then, machine learning regression models were created to predict how much profit would be made from those who were likely to donate.
