# Data Science Projects
Hello, my name is Dan Colvin. I am a passionate Data Scientist with 5+ years of relevant data analysis/data science experience and a Master's Degree in Data Science (formerly Predictive Analytics) from Northwestern University. Feel free to view a few of my past projects which showcase my experience in Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning using R and Python.

## Project Summary
Read below for a short description of each project. Then select the Jupyter Notebook for the project to see how I solved the problem as well as the code used to reach a solution.

#### Energy savings measurement and verification
This is an example of my main role at the Energy Conservation Office. Engineers in the office identify and fix inefficiencies related to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in campus buildings at UC Davis. Using multiple linear regression, I create a descriptive model of energy use before a project is initiated. The model is applied to the post-project time period to represent how much energy would have been used and is compared to real data to quantify energy savings.
- Models explored to solve business problem: **Multiple Linear Regression**

#### Predicting restaurant visitors in Japan
The capstone project for my graduate program was to solve a practical business problem to completion. My team chose to create a product to help new and existing restaurant owners predict restaurant visitors based on time, cuisine, or location. We also created a Tableau dashboard and a web-based application. The folder contains an executive summary, project goals, initial findings, final report, screenshots of our product deliverables, and R code used for machine learning. 
- Models explored to solve business problem: **Multiple Linear Regression, ARIMA, Neural Network Auto-Regression, k-Means, XGBoost**

#### Predicting chilled water deltaT for more efficient operation
This project developed a predictive model to predict the difference in supply and return temperatures for the UC Davis district chilled water system. By predicting chilled water deltaT, central heating and cooling plant operators can allocate the proper amount of resources to produce the cooling energy instead of the traditional method of using the same amount of resources every day regardless of actual campus demand. 
- Models explored to solve business problem: **Multiple Linear Regression, H2O, LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Neural Network, Keras Deep Learning LSTM**

#### Targeted marketing to increase profits
Instead of sending a pamphlet to all potential donors, this project explored targeting specific groups who were most likely to donate to a given organization. Given a dataset of historical donations and census data, various machine learning classification models were explored to predict the likelihood of a donation. Then, machine learning regression models were created to predict how much profit would be made from those groups expected to donate. The folder contains the final report from the project, screenshots of both the classification and regression model comparison, and R code used for the project.
- Models explored to solve business problem: **Logistic Regression, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, k-Means, Bagging Ensemble, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Ensemble, Support Vector Machine, Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression**
